# Features

*  Tiny core written with extensibility in mind ([open/closed principle][8]).
*  Optimized for speed; it loads in under a millisecond.
*  The master branch tries to be as stable as possible, and new features are merged in only after they have gone through a [full regression test][33].
*  Unit testing suite.
